##Impulse

The use of gifs in our society has become more popular over the years, conversations have become easier to understand and text messages are given more context with a simple moving image. For this reason, we believe that Impulse is able to bring another fun and original game experience for the users. With the use of Giphy, Spotify and Socket.io users are able to customize their playing experience between different game modes and game party sizes. The main game mode that Impulse brings to the party consists of the use of a random or player-written prompt in which the other participants have to react to with a chosen Gif within the time limit. Overall, Impulse is capable of delivering users a great local or online game experience that is fun, funny, and completely easy to handle.
